There is a programming project in assignment3.
Description of This project:
I developed a target application which runs queries on the Yelp data and extracts useful information. The
primary users for this application will be potential customers seeking for businesses and users that match their
search criteria. This application will have a user interface that provides the user the available business categories
(main, sub-categories), the attributes associated with each business category along with business review and yelp
user information associated with each business category. Using this application the user will search for the
businesses from various business categories that have the properties (attributes) the user is looking for.

Faceted search has become a popular technique in commercial search applications, particularly for online
retailers and libraries. It is a technique for accessing information organized according to a faceted classification
system, allowing users to explore a collection of information by applying multiple filters. Faceted search is the
dynamic clustering of items or search results into categories that let users drill into search results (or even skip
searching entirely) by any value in any field. Users can then “drill down” by applying specific constraints to the
search results. Look at https://react.rocks/tag/Faceted_Search for some examples.

In this application, the user can filter the search results using available business attributes (i.e. facets) such as
category, sub-category, attributes, reviews, stars and votes. Each time the user clicks on a facet value; the set of
results is reduced to only the items that have that value. Additional clicks continue to narrow down the search—
the previous facet values are remembered and applied again.
